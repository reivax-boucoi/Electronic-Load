Input :

Voltage = 4.8V		USB (before diode so to not backfeed)

=> implies to step down for system power with linear reg (inefficient)

Current = 

Output :

Voltage = 12V nom +-.3V ripple max
Current = ~0.3A 	system + fan(beware of turn on current)


Calculation :

Pout = 12*.3 = 3.6W
Estimated efficiency = 70%
Pin = 3.6/.7 = 5.2W	Is this doable with USB ? What params for MCP2221A to request current ?
